# Diario
A very simple diary app. Just add some descriptions and photos of your days. Useful during travels. Works great on phones.

Just put everything to a folder on your web site and launch diainst.php.

Then from the browser on your phone or PC navigate to diario.php (https:\\yoursite.com\yourfolder\diario.php) and start using the diary system.
Remember to save every day at the bottom of the page.

Some tools are included to check and mantain the simple archive.

diagnosi.php checks if all the folders and permissions are ok. If not, please run fixa.php.
recover.php tryes to recover a backup file of your diary.
Export.php exports the dairy in .json format.
The photos are not exported so just download them from the uploads folder if necessary.

Enjoy!
